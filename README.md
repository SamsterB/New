Data Analyst- Final Project 
This project focuses on the techniques used for data analysis. 
For this project I have used Excel, MySQL and Power BI 
I used a marketing data set from Kaggle that looked at customers and different campaigns that they have responded to.

Marketing Campaign | Kaggle

My data set contained the following rows:
ID
Year_Birth
AcceptedCmp1 - 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 1st campaign, 0 otherwise
AcceptedCmp2 - 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 2nd campaign, 0 otherwise
AcceptedCmp3 - 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 3rd campaign, 0 otherwise
AcceptedCmp4 - 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 4th campaign, 0 otherwise
AcceptedCmp5 - 1 if customer accepted the offer in the 5th campaign, 0 otherwise
Response (target) - 1 if customer accepted the offer in the last campaign, 0 otherwise
Complain - 1 if customer complained in the last 2 years
DtCustomer - date of customer’s enrolment with the company
Education - customer’s level of education
Marital - customer’s marital status
Kidhome - number of small children in customer’s household
Teenhome - number of teenagers in customer’s householdncome –

NumWebPurchases - number of purchases made through company’s web site
NumWebVisitsMonth - number of visits to company’s web site in the last month
Recency - number of days since the last purchase

I learned how to use formulas in excel to identify different patterns and trends 
I used MySQL to learn how to manipulate data by using queries to provide and outcome 
I used Power BI to create a visual representation of my findings by applying filters to the data 

I found that the largest number of customers are between the ages of 51-57 
The most successful campaign was campaign 4
The least successful campaign was campaign 2 
The largest proportion of customers were married followed closely by together 
The store purchases were higher than web purchases 
A large number of customers were parents 
Those whose level of education was of a Graduate level provided the largest number of sales 
The largest customer base had an income between £50k-£75k

To Conclude:

The company should run a campaign that is similar to ‘Campaign 4’ aimed at parents between the ages 51-57, with an income over £50k, educated to degree level.

I do feel that my data selection was limited to an extent, as I do not feel that it had enough numbers to work with or to analyse. 

I decided to add a Total sales column, which I felt helped me interpret the data better.
